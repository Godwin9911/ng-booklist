# NgBooklist

Angular client that consumes a Book list API I created. CRUD Operations can be performed from here to a nodeJs backend.

## What I Learnt/did

* Routing to various components. 
* Using Route Resolver to fetch Data before a page loads.
* Lazy Load pages to improve performance
* Using Angular HTTP client to consume a Rest API.
* Creating fuctions that returns an Observable HTTP response and subscribing to responses from a backend Server.
* Perform CRUD operations from this APP to a nodeJS backend API.

## Side Info

This is the frontend of a fullstack App I created where you can create a collection of books.
Really utitlized the Angular CLI to generate, components and Services.
